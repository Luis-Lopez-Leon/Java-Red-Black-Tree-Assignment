# Java-Red-Black-Tree-Assignment
Spring 2022 Data Structures &amp; Algorithms Assignment 2

Red-Black Tree:

Provide a step by step process of building a RB Tree out of your first name + your last name
with no spaces. For simplicity we limit the number of characters to 10 letters. If you run short of
10 characters by appending your last name to your first name, use your middle name, or just add
your pet’s name etc!! Just come up with 10 characters that start with your first name + last
name.

You must mention the exact string of characters that you start building a RB Tree out of at the
beginning of the file/s you submit.

The mandatory requirements:

• Clearly "color" the nodes Red or Black. This property must be visibly detectable in your
submission.

• Redraw each step separately, do not group changes. And most importantly label different cases
as they occur upon insertion of a new character in your RB Tree.

The credit will be heavily based on the clarity of steps, the coloring of the nodes, the labeling of
the cases and the organization of your work leading to your final answer.
